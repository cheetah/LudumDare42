# Asteroid
This repo contains all the sources of my [Ludum Dare 42](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/asteroid) game. This is not an example of good code, but it does the job. Maybe someday i'll refactor it and implement features that I didn't have time to add before deadline.

You can play it online [here](https://cheetah.github.io/ld42/)
